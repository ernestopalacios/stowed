# CONFIG FILES
## date: 26-jan-2026

At the time of creation, I have three main machines:
- Frantic: home: CachyOS/Niri
- Ducky: work: Comsmic/Wayland
- XPS: laptop: Cosmic/Gnome -> plan on changing it to Cachy too!!!

### [bug][todo]

1. CachyOS makes the program `dragon` as `dragon-drop` I should change the name on Cosmic.
2. Backup Scripts
3. Sync with Obsidian MD
